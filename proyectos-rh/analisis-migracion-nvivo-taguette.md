In this table, we compare some of the functionalities of Nvivo and Taguette to see which data might not be able to migrate to Taguette. As we can see, Nvivo has more data analysis and visualization options than Taguette, and it also supports importing social media data, which currently is not available in Taguette, but might be in the future if the project receives enough support. However, both platforms offer similar features for text analysis, data coding, thematic analysis, and content analysis, so data related to these functionalities should be able to migrate, depending of the complexity and size of the source project in Nvivo.

It would be necessary to have more information about your use case and the background of the decision, but in general, I wouldn't recommend migrating a complete project from Nvivo to Taguette. However, it is possible to migrate some parts of it, and in some cases, it may be necessary to migrate data manually.
